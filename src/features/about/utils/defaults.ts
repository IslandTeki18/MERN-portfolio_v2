  "Lives in the great state of Utah. Has a beautiful wife and two daughters. He is a descendant of the Samoan people. He started his tech journey in 2018 by attending a coding bootcamp for iOS Development. Found that the iOS market here in Utah was a tough market to get into especially if you don’t have experience. He taught himself Web Development and started applying for jobs and eventually landed one. It’s been history ever since.";
